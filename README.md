# Teaching From Home technology

This is a page to collect some of my thoughts and recommendations about techology you can use to teach from home. By “teach,” I mean both teaching students enrolled in a class, and presenting to participants in a research seminar. Those are my focus only because in my job I teach college students and present research, but hopefully some of this is useful for other purposes too—like online meetings and socializing.

Four quick caveats; three are quick and numbered, while the last one is most important so gets its own paragraph:
1. This is a work in progress. I know more than I’ve written up, but I’m also learning more all the time.
2. I am not trained in this, and I am not an expert. (My professional expertise touches financial and labor economics.) There are many real experts, from whom I’ve learned a lot and you should too. But I think there are also things you can learn from me, which is why I’m putting this page together. *Caveat lector.*
3. This page includes affiliate links which—if you click on them and make purchases—earn me a little bit of money. No one’s (yet) offered me any discounted products or sponsorships of any kind, but I acknowledge the risk that these affiliate risks affect my incentives to recommend expensive products. Offsetting that, I am a cheapskate who has bought most of this stuff, and bought all of that out of my own pocket (usually unreimbursed by college funds). *Caveat emptor.*

Here’s the most important caution: I suspect that **good technology doesn’t mean good teaching**, whatever “good” teaching even means. (And whatever it means, the best teachers are probably more focused on learning than teaching, anyway.) This page is about teaching *technology* not because technology is so important, but because I believe it‘s important *enough* to be worth thinking about. As I mentioned above, I‘m not an expert, but here are some reasons I think you should consider improving your teaching technology:
* Direct effects
1. Student engagement
2. Student understanding
3. Credibility

##### Indirect effects
4. Ability to focus on teaching
5. Signalling
6. Pride of craft
